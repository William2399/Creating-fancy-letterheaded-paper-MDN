# Creating-fancy-letterheaded-paper-MDN

My version of MDN's Assessment: Creating fancy letterheaded paper

The objective of the assignment is "to test comprehension of CSS
box model, and other box-related features such as 
implementing backgrounds." You are given the files needed
in order to create a letterheaded paper template as well as a 
description of what CSS code needs to be added.
